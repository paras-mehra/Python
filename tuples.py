# <================ Python Tuples ===============>

# A Tuple is created by Placing all the items inside parentheses(), separated by commas. The parentheses are optional, however, it is a good practice to use them.
# Tuples are immutable. This means that elements of a Tuple cannot be changed once it has been assigned.
# ===================================================================================

a = ("P","A","R","A","S")
print(a)
print(type(a))

# Strings are Immutable
# name = "Paras" 
# name[3] = "i" 
# print(name)

# Tuples are Immutable
# a[0] = "k"
# print(a)
